# `simp`

`simp` is a very simple plugin that literally only does one thing, it makes my editing easier, with `htns` instead of `hjkl` and when I want to try other people's configs I can install this plugin as well and not have to worry about having to use `hjkl` when trying those configs.

This plugin also features some `simp`le remaps

# dvorak-simp 

dvorak-simp is a very simple plugin that literally only does one thing, it makes my editing easier, with `htns` instead of `hjkl` and when I want to try other people's configs I can install this plugin as well and not have to worry about having to use `hjkl` when trying those configs.

## Install (lazy)
```lua
return { 'adamkali/dvorak-simp.nvim' }
```

## Install (packer)
```lua
use { 'adamkali/dvorak-simp.nvim' } 
```

## Install (vim-plug)
```lua
Plug 'adamkali/dvorak-simp.nvim'
```
> [!WARNING]
> This is literally a useless plugin that is made specifically for me.
